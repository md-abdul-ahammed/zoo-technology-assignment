## Overview

I have successfully implemented the project with dynamic features. This project uses Redux and Axios to manage state and handle HTTP requests, respectively. Although I could have accomplished the task without these tools, I wanted to use them to ensure a professional approach. I am very happy with the outcome of this assignment as it provided a valuable learning experience.
